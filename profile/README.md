## Are There More Ways To Save on IXL?

Yes, apart from those IXL promo deals, there are more ways to save on your IXL membership.

### 1. Get IXL Membership for FREE

Yes, now you can get an IXL membership for free for [**30 days**](https://in.ixl.com/) as a free trial. This offer is only valid for new users.

During this trial, explore all the premium courses and features on the platform and decide for yourself whether IXL is worth your time and money.

### 2. IXL Black Friday & Cyber Monday Deal

Keep an eye out for the biggest sale on IXL, like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Back-to-School season.

You can **save up to 60%** on your IXL membership with these seasonal sales.

### 3. IXL Family Membership Discount

**Have more than one child?**

An IXL Family membership would be a smart choice, it’s more affordable than buying individual accounts for each child.

With a family plan, all your kids can learn at the same time, and their progress stays separate.

That means you save money **and** give each child their own personalized learning path.

### 4. Save More with Long-Term Plans

Always choose the annual plan instead of choosing monthly on IXL; this way, you save up to 50% on your IXL membership.

Yearly subscriptions are cheaper overall compared to paying for 12 months separately.

If you know you’ll be using IXL for a full year, this is a great way to **cut down on costs**.

## IXL Pricing Plan - How Much Does It Cost?

Now, let’s talk about how much IXL membership actually costs.

Here’s an overview:

## The IXL Experience: What Users Are Saying?

Let’s hear from some of the amazing IXL reviews I found online, which will help you decide better on choosing the platform.

User [r/homeschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) on Reddit

“I use Reading Eggs, but I am looking for a digital app that would give my kids English and math review on the side. IXL seems to offer both, and it looks like they have plenty of curriculum. They do not use a trial, so I am asking before I sign up. I already have an unhealthy amount of worksheet site subscriptions…”

User [mjolnir76](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) on Reddit -

In my experience as a private math tutor (and 8 years as a public school math teacher), IXL is fine for reinforcement of math topics, but is not a great initial teaching tool. Maybe it has changed since I last used it, but I wouldn’t recommend it as the primary teaching method

User [bythewar](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) on Reddit -

I like IXL. When working on a concept, it’s pretty easy to score a 90/100. However, the final ten points require true mastery of the content. Missing the last few questions can knock you back, but it’s not hard to get to 90.
